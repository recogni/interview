Recogni's barebones software developer interview environment checker

## What is this?

Welcome to the Recogni software developer interview process! We are excited to chat with you over a virtual coding session.

## What do I need?

Hopefully not much more than a development system with an environment to write code with. We expect you to bring your favorite text editor, terminal and tools. You will be expected to fetch code from a Git repository, share your screen and ideally have a web-cam as well. We typically expect you to have a working `gcc`/`g++`/`Python`,etc. which this project will validate once you are ready. If you have a Linux or macOS environment handy, you're ready to roll. Otherwise, you may want to bring up a free VM with your favorite Linux distribution on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute). Any UN\*Xish terminal access will do!

In the interest of having this process be as pain free as possible, we require you to please complete a few steps prior to your scheduled interview:

1. Clone this repository to the machine you will be joining our virtual session from.
2. Type `make` (or just `make cc` if you are interviewing for an embedded software C/C++-only position here).
3. Make sure there are no exit codes in the `make` process.
4. Verify that you have a decent microphone, and a quiet place to talk to us from.
5. Familiarize yourself with how to join a [Google Hangouts Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9303069) session with a meeting URL we will share with you on the day of your interview.

## What can I expect?

Please expect to have 2-3 technical sessions which last from 45 minutes to an hour each. You are free to have a browser window open to Google or look up various man pages, API documents and what-have-yous.
