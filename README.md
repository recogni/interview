# interview

Recogni's barebones interview env checker

## What is this?

Welcome to the Recogni interview process! We are excited to chat with you over a virtual coding session.

## What do I need?

Hopefully not much more than a development system with an environment to write code with. We expect you to bring your favorite text editor, terminal and tools. You will be expected to fetch code from a git repository, share your screen and ideally have a web-cam as well. We typically expect you to have a working gcc/g++/python etc which this project will validate once you are ready.

In the interest of having this process be as pain free as possible, we require a few steps from you:

1. Clone this repo to the machine you will be joining our virtual session from.
2. Type `make`, or (`make cc` if you are seeking an embedded-c only position here).
3. Make sure there are no exit codes in the make process.
4. Verify that you have a decent mic, and a quiet place to talk to us from.

## What can I expect?

Please expect to have 2-3 technical sessions which last from 45 minutes to an hour each. You are free to have a browser window open to google, or look up various man pages, APIs and what-have-yous.

## Other things?

For all other items, please feel free to email `jobs@recogni.com` with your full name and the words `"Interview Query"` somewhere in the subject of the email (or reach out to one of us from our website!).
